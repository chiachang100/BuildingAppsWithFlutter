## Q&A
* [Where is Dart's SDK located within /flutter folder?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50321966/where-is-darts-sdk-located-within-flutter-folder)  
  * The Dart SDK bundled with flutter is located in the folder `flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin`.
* [System cache directory](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/glossary#system-cache)
  * "When pub gets a remote package, it downloads it into a single system cache directory maintained by pub."
    * On Mac and Linux, this directory defaults to `~/.pub-cache`.
    * On Windows, the file lives in `%APPDATA%\Pub\Cache\bin`.
