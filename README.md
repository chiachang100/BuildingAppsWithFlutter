  * The Dart SDK bundled with flutter is located in the folder `flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin`.
* [System cache directory](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/glossary#system-cache)
  * "When pub gets a remote package, it downloads it into a single system cache directory maintained by pub."
    * On Mac and Linux, this directory defaults to `~/.pub-cache`.
